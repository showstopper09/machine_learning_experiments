# machine_learning_experiments
Here I have a few of the code files, for the machine learning experiments I have been working on.
Most of the datasets are from the UCI, except for the bird classifier one-this one is from caltect vision repository.
Each folder has a brief description of the topic, the dataset and the experiment.
